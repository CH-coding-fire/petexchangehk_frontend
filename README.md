[petexchangehk.com][1] is a web app for pet adoptions and transactions that emphasize simplicity and convenience to save users the most time.  

## Motivation and story behind the app.
This app intends to solve the problem that currently pet adoption platforms in Hong Kong are scattered and chaotic. Once I wanted to adopt a hamster, it took me 5 hours to search through Facebook groups, Instagram, and WhatsApp groups. The reason is that these platforms are not specialized for searching for pets, there are no options to filter according to characteristics such as animal species, age, health, adoption requirements, etc. What is worse is for example Facebook can only show two posts at once on a screen. Overall it is a pain to find animals for adoption. 

## Highlights of functionalities:

 - To allow easy filtering of animal species, the classification of animal species is all strictly standardized.
 - To ensure the aesthetics of animal photos, the photos are processed by the AI of Cloudinary to crop the photos to square and focused correctly.
 - In the detailed description of the animal, it is standardized what kind of information is necessary, so users can easily compare animals descriptions
 - It accommodates special needs such as animals that need urgent attention would be displayed in bold red fonts.
 - To save users from continuously updating their animalsâ€™ age, ages are all updated every day automatically.
 - The sequence of display of animals can affect their chance of getting adopted. Therefore, the sequence is randomized most of the time.
 - FilePond provides a seamless file-uploading experience.
 - Supports both desktop and mobile
